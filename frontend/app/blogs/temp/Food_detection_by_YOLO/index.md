# Project summary

> 💡 This project implements a YOLOv8 object detection model for identifying objects in video and image data.

## Project background

> 💡 As you may see: this is conducted by the Data Science Lab @Yonsei University. There are 2 teams to do the same topic project. And our team has 6 people.

## Parts by me

> 💡 I firstly was in charge of test the YOLOv8n model for the task. Luckily this model got the best performance among the models.

## My comment

> 💡 First time experiencing object detection and vision model finetuning, and data labeling is soo tired. But we got a pretty good result. As for my last scheduled project in DSL, it’s a perfect farewell.
